### Introduction

Create a list of prime numbers with *Python* is not really a big deal, but manage it in a convinient way and have it done efficiently is another story.

In this repository we explore some mathematical resources and apply them to improve the efficiency of the code, everything is explained in a easy way, with accessible language and examples, but basic knowledge of *Python* is required.

Repository files list:

- README.md

    This file
    
- PrimeNumbersPython.ipynb

    Jupyter notebook with *Python* code and mathematical background explanation.
